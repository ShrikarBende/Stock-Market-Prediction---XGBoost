## üìÇ Overview

This project focuses on predicting the closing price of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock using historical market data and a powerful gradient boosting model. The goal is to build an accurate XGBoost Regressor that can forecast stock prices based on key daily indicators like opening price, daily high/low, and trading volume. This analysis demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in financial time-series forecasting.

## ‚ú® Project Features

* **Data Exploration & Visualization**: In-depth analysis of historical trends, trading volume, and price distributions.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Feature scaling using `StandardScaler` to normalize the data for the model.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Implementation of an XGBoost Regressor for high-accuracy predictions.
* **Model Evaluation**: Rigorous evaluation using standard regression metrics like R-squared, MSE, and MAE.
* **Result Visualization**: Clear and insightful plots comparing predicted vs. actual stock prices.

---

## üìà Dataset & Exploration

The project utilizes the **TSLA.csv** dataset, containing daily stock data for Tesla from **June 29, 2010, to March 24, 2022**.

* **Target Variable**: `Close`
* **Features Used**: `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Volume`

### Data Visualizations

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The prediction workflow consists of these steps:
1.  **Data Loading**: The `TSLA.csv` dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Feature Scaling**: The independent variables (`Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Volume`) are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
3.  **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.
4.  **Model Training**: An **XGBoost Regressor** is trained on the scaled training data.

## üìä Results and Evaluation

The model's performance on the test set was exceptional, indicating a highly accurate and reliable predictor.

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **R¬≤ Score** | `0.9986` |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | `$3.09` |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** | `78.18` |

### Prediction Visualizations
